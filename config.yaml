      I'm a seasoned technology leader rooted in Columbus, OH, currently spearheading innovation at Cardinal Health. With a solid foundation in computer science and mathematics, I thrive at the crossroads of technology and groundbreaking innovation. My current endeavor involves a pioneering project aimed at revolutionizing patient careâ€”enabling hospital-level care in the comfort of one's home, a testament to my commitment to driving industry disruptions.

      My expertise spans across AI, Vision Technology, Design Thinking, lean methodologies, and agile practices. My fervor isn't just limited to technology. I love the outdoors, spending time with my family, and I'm equally passionate about running. Well, "passionate" might be a strong word. Let's just say I run... occasionally.
